Text analyzer and classifier

Scripts and Files included:
--------------------------
1) text_analyzer.py: This is the script used to analyze all algorithms in part.
   It accepts as input the location of the training and test data and an output
   png filename to draw the plots. This script will also print results in a
   tabular format.
Example run: text_analyzer.py /user/Selected_20NewsGroup /user/output_plots.png

2) get_best_naive_bayes.py: This is the script used to check all 8 or more
   configurations for the NaiÌˆve Bayes algorithm which was best-performing. It
   accepts as input the location of the training and test data and outputs
   results for all configurations in a tabular format.
Example run: get_best_naive_bayes.py /user/Selected_20NewsGroup

3) generate_model_with_best_config.py: This script is used to generate a new
   model based on the best config. It accepts as input the location of the
   training data alone and generates a model and dumps it to a .pkl file in the
   current working directory.
Example run: generate_model_with_best_config.py /user/Selected_20News/Training
Pickle file generated: full_model.pkl

4) full_model.pkl: A full_model.pkl file generated using the above script with
   the given training and test data

5) run_model_with_best_config.py: This script is used to run the model generated
   by generate_model_with_best_config.py. It accepts as input the location of
   the test data alone. It expects the above full_model.pkl file to be in the
   current working directory.
Example run: run_model_with_best_config.py /user/Selected_20NewsGroup/Test

The report file on the tests run and a zipped version of the dataset have also
been included.
